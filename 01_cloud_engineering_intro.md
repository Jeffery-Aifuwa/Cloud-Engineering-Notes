## Introduction to Cloud Engineering

### What is Cloud Engineering?

Cloud engineering helps applications become accessible worldwide. Without it, an app is just code sitting on a laptop. Cloud engineers give applications wings by deploying them to the cloud, making sure they stay available, scalable, and secure as more users access them.

> Think of the cloud as someone else's computer that you're paying to use, just like renting an Airbnb or a serviced apartment instead of buying a house.

Our job as cloud engineers is to know which resources to use, when to use them, and how to manage them efficiently to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Popular Cloud Platforms

Some of the biggest cloud providers include:
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** – 31% market share
- **Google Cloud (GC)** – 12% market share
- **Microsoft Azure** – 20% market share
- **Linode**
- **DigitalOcean**

### What Do Cloud Engineers Do?

Cloud engineers are responsible for:
- **Making Applications Accessible** – Deploying apps to cloud platforms so anyone can use them.
- **Preventing Downtime** – Ensuring apps stay online, even with heavy traffic.
- **Enhancing Security** – Protecting apps from cyber threats.
- **Automating Infrastructure** – Using code to manage cloud resources efficiently.
- **Optimizing Performance & Costs** – Ensuring smooth performance without wasting resources.

### Skills Needed for Cloud Engineering

To be a solid cloud/DevOps engineer, you need to know:
- **Linux** – The backbone of most cloud environments.
- **Docker** – Helps package applications so they run the same way everywhere.
- **Git** – Version control to track code changes.
- **CI/CD** – Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment.
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as code.
- **Ansible** – Automates server configurations.
- **Kubernetes** – Manages containers at scale.
- **Python/Node.js** – Useful for automation.
- **Databases** – Storing and managing data.
- **CloudFormation** – AWS-specific tool for infrastructure automation.
- **AWS, Azure** – Major cloud platforms.
- **Bash** – Scripting for automation.

> If you're focused specifically on being a cloud engineer:
- **AWS, Azure** – The core cloud platforms.
- **Bash** – To automate cloud tasks.

### Key Components of Cloud Engineering

#### 1. System Administration
- Manages cloud infrastructure, servers, and user permissions.
- Ensures smooth system operation and troubleshooting.

#### 2. DevSecOps (Development, Security, and Operations)
- Integrates security into cloud development from the start.
- Automates security checks to detect vulnerabilities early.

#### 3. Observability
- Uses logs, metrics, and traces to monitor cloud systems.
- Helps detect and fix issues before they affect users.

#### 4. Networking
- Sets up virtual networks, VPNs, and firewalls.
- Ensures secure and fast communication between cloud resources.

#### 5. Automation & Scripting
- Uses tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **AWS CloudFormation** to automate infrastructure setup.
- Reduces manual work and human errors.

#### 6. Cloud Security
- Protects data and applications with **IAM**, **encryption**, and **firewalls**.
- Ensures compliance with security best practices.
