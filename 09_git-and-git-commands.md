## What is Git and Why Is It Important?

Git is a version control system, which means it helps you keep track of changes you make to files‚Äîespecially code‚Äîover time. It‚Äôs like a super-smart diary that remembers every edit, who made it, and when.

With Git, you can:
- Undo mistakes and go back to earlier versions.
- Work with others without messing up each other‚Äôs work.
- Keep your code backed up and safe online (with GitHub, GitLab, etc).
- Experiment with new ideas in branches without breaking the original work.

Whether you're building a website, writing software, or managing configuration files in cloud engineering, Git gives you control, safety, and collaboration power.
